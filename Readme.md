### App UI Styling
```
http://nativebase.io
```

NativeBase is packed with three preset themes.

- Platform: The default theme of NativeBase which maps to the design of the platform where the app runs.

- Material: Sometimes, you need Material design for both the platforms. Not everyone is a fan but Google does use Material design on iOS. This theme is not 100% material yet but it can be used today.

- Common Colors: Most of the brands use a common color scheme for both the platforms but they also follow platform specific icons, font and orientation of the components. Common Colors theme is best suited for such use-cases.
